Welcome to **MealDB Recipe Finder**! ðŸŽ‰

# Note for Julien

Due to a small misunderstanding regarding the use of the `useReducer` hook, probably due to a lack of clarity on my part when responding, I am here applying a very simple app state initializer with actions and dispatches set manually using a switch-case to demonstrate my understanding of the hook's usage. Instead of initializing these states separately with `useState`, I thought it was a good opportunity to showcase a use case for the hook. Of course, there are more advanced and applicable solutions for more robust and scalable scenarios, such as initializing states from the server instead of having them in the app's entry file, but ultimately, it's to demonstrate my understanding of this hook.

This challenge was fun, and I want to thank you for considering me. Part of the components and modules of my app are documented, and some mappings have comments explaining why I decided to index them in certain ways.

If I had had a slightly more relaxed deadline, I would have implemented toast alerts, improved the user experience, generated `srcSet`s to map the images, and enhanced responsiveness with a new CSS feature that avoids using an event listener with javscript as we are usually accustomed to.

I would also have set variables with Sass for Tailwind, including colors, mixins, breakpoints, `toRem()` functions, and other details to improve the scalability and modularity of the code.

I hope my challenge meets your expectations, and I am really looking forward to working with you.

Anyway, I present myself as a team player. It was a pleasure meeting you, and thank you once again.
